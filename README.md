Turntable.fm Autopilot Extension for Google Chrome
==================================================

You enable autopilot mode in [turntable.fm](http://turntable.fm/) by going to a room and clicking on Settings > Start Autopilot.

When enabled, autopilot mode does the following:

- Automatically grabs any available DJ spot.
- Adds music to your playlist based on what others are playing (uses the last.fm api).
- Automatically upvotes songs played by others.

For the main program logic, see src/autopilot.sjs ([Stratified JavaScript](http://onilabs.com/stratifiedjs) code).
